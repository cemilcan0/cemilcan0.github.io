            <h1>Mario Balotelli</h1>
            <p>Balotelli started his professional football career in 2005 at Lumezzane, before joining Inter Milan in 
                2007. He won the treble (Serie A, Coppa Italia, and Champions League) in 2010. Balotelli reunited with
                 Internazionale manager Roberto Mancini at Manchester City in 2010, helping them win a Premier League
                  title and FA Cup. He moved back to Italy in January 2013, signing for AC Milan, before returning to 
                  the Premier League with Liverpool 18 months later. Following a return to Milan on loan, Balotelli 
                  departed to France, playing for Nice and Marseille in Ligue 1. He returned to Italy a third time, 
                  joining Serie A club Brescia in summer 2019, and Serie B club Monza in late 2020. The following summer, 
                  Balotelli signed for Turkish club Adana Demirspor.

                Balotelli earned his first cap for Italy in a friendly match against the Ivory Coast in 2010. 
                He amassed over 30 caps and represented his country at UEFA Euro 2012, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup,
                 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He helped the national side reach the final of Euro 2012, scoring twice
                  against Germany in the semi-final, and won bronze at the Confederations Cup. Balotelli is Italy's 
                  joint-top-scorer in the UEFA European Championship,[8] and joint-top-scorer in the FIFA ConfederationsCup.</p>
