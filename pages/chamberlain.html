            <h1>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain
            </h1>
            <p>Alexander Mark David Oxlade-Chamberlain (born 15 August 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays
                 as a midfielder for Süper Lig club Beşiktaş.

                After rising to prominence with Southampton during the 2010–11 season aged 17, Oxlade-Chamberlain signed for
                 Arsenal in August 2011. Scoring twice in his first three matches for the club, Oxlade-Chamberlain became the
                  youngest English goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history and also claimed a regular place in the 
                  England under-21 team. Over his six seasons at Arsenal, he played 198 games and scored 20 goals, winning 
                  the FA Cup three times. He signed for Liverpool in August 2017, winning the 2018–19 Champions League and 
                  2019–20 Premier League.
                
                Oxlade-Chamberlain made his debut for the England national team in May 2012 in a 1–0 win against Norway in a 
                friendly. Following this, he received a surprise call-up to the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012 and became 
                the second youngest player ever to represent England in the European Championships behind Wayne Rooney, later
                 to be overtaken by Jude Bellingham as well. He was also called up for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He has made 
                 35 appearances for the national team, the latest in 2019, scoring seven goals.</p>
