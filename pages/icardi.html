                a striker for Süper Lig club Galatasaray.Icardi began his footballing career at the youth teams of 
                Vecindario and passed through La Masia, the youth system of La Liga club Barcelona, before moving to
                 Serie A club Sampdoria to begin his professional career in 2012. After an impressive season, he joined 
                 Inter Milan in July 2013,[4] where he developed into one of the most prolific strikers in Europe. Icardi
                  won the Capocannoniere in both the 2014–15 and 2017–18 seasons,[note 1] and was named the captain of Inter
                   in 2015, at age 22.[5] Three years later, Icardi was integral for Inter reaching a place in the UEFA 
                   Champions League, their first time in six years,[6] as he became the club's eighth-highest goalscorer
                    of all time.[7] In 2019, Icardi signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an initial one-year loan deal,[8] 
                    where he won a domestic treble. He then joined the club permanently for €50 million. After a successful
                     season on loan to Galatasaray where he led the side to a Süper Lig title, Icardi joined permanently in
                     2023 for a €10 million fee.[9]</p>
